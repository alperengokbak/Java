1. First practice is about calculating your notes' avarage.
2. Second one is about how to calculate the vat price of the product you purchased is.
3. And third one calculates the area of the triangle what you set the edges. At the same time, There is a different project in the same file. It finds hypotenuse' length what you set short edge of triangle.
4. Fourth one is about taxi metres. It's calculating what you have to pay amount of wage, but there are some rules while calculating wage. one of them is beginning wage is 10 dollars. Wage'll increase 2.20 dolar per km. Even if total wage is under the 20 dollar, you have to pay 20 dollars anyway.
5. We're countinue fifth one. I'm trying to show you how to calculate field of the circle easily with these examples. 
6. Let's continue with how to calculate Body Mass Index. I did it example basically inside of practice 6.
7. The Seventh one can be necessary for your daily routine. I did this program to calculate what you buy in the grocery store and how much you have to pay.
